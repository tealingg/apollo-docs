# 1: Welcome to Apollo!

Hey there! Welcome to Apollo's blog, where you'll see everything from development updates, to changelogs, to everything in between. This blog post is mostly just an introduction to Apollo and what I'll be doing in the near future.

<!-- more -->

Warning: this might get a bit tech-heavy, so if you're not into that side of things, check out the [main documentation](../../index.md).

## What is Apollo?

Apollo is intended to be an extensible mod for Mario Kart Wii, using ELF files to provide a modular interface for creating extensions.

Its design will be based on [BrainSlug](https://github.com/Chadderz121/brainslug-wii) by the wonderful [Chadderz](https://github.com/Chadderz121), which is a more generalised modding framework which follows a similar approach as to what I'd like to take with Apollo.

## What's Done?

At the moment, nothing. I need to create a base for the launcher, an easy way to create mod files, etc. and therefore, a beta build of Apollo isn't on the horizon just yet, however stay tuned for more blog posts to keep updated on what's happening.

## Thanks!

A special thank you to the following:

- [stebler](https://github.com/stblr): for the (now abandoned) [MKW-SP project](https://github.com/mkw-sp/mkw-sp). It's one of the things which originally inspired me to create apollo.
- [Chadderz](https://github.com/Chadderz121): for [BrainSlug](https://github.com/Chadderz121/brainslug-wii). BrainSlug's base is the starting point for Apollo and lots of code will be inspired/used from it (thank you!).
- You: for reading this blog post. Whether it's relatively recently in July 2024 or in the distant future, no matter when you're reading this, it means a lot that you're paying attention.

With that being said, I hope to be able to bring you some updates soon.
