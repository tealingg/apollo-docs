# Apollo: An Introduction

## What is Apollo?

Apollo is a fresh take on Mario Kart Wii modding, with features such as:

- A modern and feature-rich launcher
- A robust [extension system](), which allows for certain features and mods to be enabled and disabled at the user's choice.
- Much more in the works.

## Why Apollo?

My vision of Apollo came about upon discovering this [open letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xKx21TaXAYN8lYOTMn_rIX2z6LgCiiaBfMuJnCj7vzk) from CLF78 and others. I also stumbled across the (now abandoned) [MKW-SP](https://www.github.com/mkw-sp/mkw-sp) project which really opened my eyes to the true expandability of Mario Kart Wii. Having used [CTGP-R](https://www.chadsoft.co.uk) for many years now, it seems like there really could be more done for this community.

This being said, I don't intend for Apollo to become a new modding standard, or to cause a divide in the community, rather I'm looking to make a personal project that I can make available (and fully [open-source](https://www.github.com/tealingg/apollo)!) to anyone.

## When Will Apollo be Available?

Short-term, I don't know. I may start publishing alpha/beta builds on GitHub which won't have built releases which you'll be able to compile and run yourself, however.

Long-term, I'd like to see a foundation built in the next couple of months (I'm writing this in July 2024!) and hopefully a usable, documented product not too long afterwards.
